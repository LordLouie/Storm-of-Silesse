MAP
The northern country of Silesse is in the midst of a rough patch. The country's king, Lewyn, has been missing for over a decade now.
Determined to track him down, Ced has struck off on his own in the hopes of retrieving his father.
He has yet to return, and worse yet, Silesse's beloved queen, Erinys, has recently passed away from heartbreak and terminal illness. 
This leaves only the young and ill-prepared Princess Fee to govern the Silesse territory, and many have begun to take notice.
Grannvale encroaches on Silesse's soil more and more as the weeks pass.
Commonfolk especially are spared no quarter from all this strife; sweeping crop failure has begun to plague Silesse, and many are forced to seek jobs elsewhere just to survive.
In spite of it all, some have perservered. A number of vigilante groups have sprung up around the country to provide Silessians relief- through any means necessary.
This story follows the exploits of one of these groups- Storm Cabal, headed by the son of Belhalla survivor, Neill...

OPENING

Pah... you fiends... how... how could you?
We already gave you food...

Listen, old timer, I hear ya 'n I understand, 
but we jus' need a 'lil more... that's all.

A little more?! You and your goons stole our
entire supply! With an appetite as bottomless
as yours, it's a wonder you haven't taken
the town off it's foundation!

Say... that's a great idea.

What?

Aight, boys! This whole town is ours now!
Shake the people for everything they've got!
If they don't come quietly, introduce their
pallets to the smooth taste of steel!

Urgh... have the gods truly forsaken us?
Someone... anyone... help...

C'mon, guys, just a bit further! We gotta
find a place to stay the night!

Speak for yourself, Neill! At least you've
got a comfortable horse to ride on...

Just our luck- there's a village right
in front of us!

I wouldn't celebrate too soon... looks like
it's being ravaged by bandits. Otto, you
think we can take em?

...
...
...Positive.

If so, then we must make haste! Innocent
people are under attack! Heroism now,
sustenance later!

HOUSES

Oh, Maurice... I don't think he's such
a bad fella, at heart. When he first
crawled into town, the man was scrawnier
than a seedling. 
The townsfolk were quick to give him
a room, and something to nosh on.
He soon recovered, and as his way of
thanking us, he invited his whole
posse... 
Overnight, we were swamped with demand
for bread and booze. It's like
we raised a swarm of locusts in a 
crop field.
When we ran out, they turned on us
and seized this whole town. 
The things people do just to survive...
It's wild.

Thanks for stopping by, and listening
to my spiel. 

If you're having trouble getting Maurice
to stand down, give this bow a try. 
These arrows are awful sharp... but 
please try to go easy on him, ok?

Confound Maurice and his entire posse!
We starve ourselves ragged getting them
back on their feet, and this is how they
repay us? Grr...
Luckily for us, there's a way out-
See this sword? Stick it between his eyes!
Tch... Lousy... Rotten...

Don't tell anyone, but I think one of the
bandits forgot to bring their axe to the
rumble. They left it in my house.
How 'bout instead of returning it, I 
give it to you instead? 

I jus' saw the strangest thing... 
So, I was makin' breakfast, when I looked
out my window and saw someone staring at
me. It was early in the morning, and I was
feeling groggy, so I couldn't quite tell you
who it was, but if I had to wager a guess,
I'd say it was some kind of burglar.
I would hate to be robbed, so I'm trying to
get rid of everything I have that would look
appetizing to thieves. Like this here ring!
It's yours now. I bet it has magical properties...

Where's the dispenser... on this thing...
I jus' wanna... fill a pint...
Huh? D-Damn, I've been spotted! 
Uhh... Listen, kid. this isn't what it looks like.
Hey, you better not go squealing to Maury about this!
He'll stamp on my face 'til I barf it all up!
Just... take this and keep it shut. Go on, get!

BATTLE QUOTES

Watch out! Ye don't wanna see what this 
beast is capable of when he's cornered!

Guh... never thought I'd die over a few 
crumbs of bread...

I'll make myself scarce...

ENDING

Looks like we got the last of 'em.
Where has this city's leader gone?

I'm right here... forgive me...
I've never been particularly brave...
Do my eyes deceive me?
Were you four able to defeat this
entire gang by yourselves? 
Without letting anyone come to harm?
I've hardly seen anything like this...
Truly, you lead an impeccable band of
fighters.
You have my sincerest gratitude. 

Don't sweat it, pops. Helping people is
just what we do. 
Our long journey has made my friends and I weary.
You wouldn't mind if we rested the night in town here,
would you?

Oh, not at all! Help yourselves to whatever provisions
you desire. Within reason, of course. We don't want to
have to clean you out too! Ha ha ha...

Cool! We've nearly exhausted our supply from the past
few missions.

Missions? What kind of hairball team are you leading,
young man?

I am Neill, leader of the Silessian relief group,
Storm Cabal! Our cause is dedicated to helping
those who suffer all across the nation, by hitting
the bad guys where it hurts them most- their wallets!

That's quite a sales pitch you've got there! Alright,
I've held you up long enough. Go, enjoy yourselves!
Just don't be here too long!

We'll be out of your hair by sunrise, tomorrow!

Alright, we've secured housing for the next...
couple of hours. Where do we go from here, Neill?

I'm... not sure. Ever since father gave me the
reigns to this group, I haven't
been able to make a single confident decision.

We've coasted by off of burglary for a while,
but we took a hit trying to pillage Zaxon castle,
and now we don't have any stuff...

No food, no money, and we lost most of our
weapons while making a break for it, too...

Don't let it weigh too hard on ya, buddy.
Your dearly departed pa put you in charge
of us for a reason. We've got your back.

Thanks... that really means the world to me.
Regarding our future plans, Seadna and Otto 
got some interesting news from one of the
villagers here.

Grannvale supply trains have been illegally
transporting goods out of Silesse. The purpose
of this cargo is unknown, but some suspect it 
to be stolen crop from farmers near 
the Zaxon-Lubeck border.

What Otto has said should be enough cause for
alarm, but it gets weirder. Not only are things
being shipped out of Silesse, they're also being
sent IN.
People who try to follow the transports seem to
disappear without a trace. At least, that's what
we've heard from the villagers.

The supply trains are most likely well-guarded.
The fortitude of their security relative to our
own power is unknown.

We must consider our next action very carefully.

Hmm... this is unlike anything we've ever 
done before. We can get away with robbing
greedy nobles every now and again, but to
steal from the empire? We'd be on the run
for the rest of our lives!
Still... I think its the best option we've got.
Work is drying up. Sticking up criminals isn't
bringing home butter like it used to.
We'll have to make do with what's available.

Get a good night's sleep, everyone.
It could very well be our last...

...

...

CHAPTER 2

MAP
Disregarding any sense of 
self preservation,

Neill and his friend journey to the
Zaxon-Lubeck border.

Though low on provisions, they are 
brimming with hope...

...And perhaps desperation as well.

Fortunately for Storm Cabal, a
caravan of imperial troops arrives,

right on cue...

OPENING

Day 4. We are en route to cross Silesse's
borders soon. I have utmost faith in the
empire for the task I've been assigned,
but I would be remiss were I not to 
mention the mounting pressure my team feels.
The citizenry scowl at us on the regular.
The mercenaries hired to protect our cargo
don't exactly have amicable relations with
my crew, either.
In order to avoid suspicion, an imperial
supply train leaving Silesse has transfered
their supply of children to us.
Our destination is somewhere in the Tofa
mountain range. This map shows the route,
but leaves the destination ambiguous.
The details are not my concern.
We have countless weeks of travel ahead
of us, but today will be the most difficult.
I pray the children stay quiet as we
pass through the village...
- General Tavares, 4th Supply Core of the Rotritter


This is it. The empire's supply route...

I would advise against travelling further
south, Neill. We are officially in imperial
territory. If we overstep our boundaries,
we could be swamped by their most powerful
soldiers very quickly.

Heard you loud and clear.
We'll ambush the first cargo we see
entering Silesse, take out the
imperial lackeys guarding it, and wheel 
what we find back here before the main 
force notices. Got it?

Sounds like a plan. I can't wait to
beat the tar out of those Grannvale
creeps!

Whoa! Slow your roll, Seadna! We're just
here to take what we need, not get blood
all over our hands!

Hehe... got the better of myself there...
Sorry...

All we have to do... is lie in wait...

Neill/Otto

Gerald

Things go in... things come out...
Day... after day... after day...
Damnable Grannvalians...
How great is the depth of their greed?

I cannot abide by them any longer.
Action, swift, must be taken.

...But what chance do I alone have
against an entire army?

Hmm...
It appears that vigilante group is
gearing up to attack a transport...

Bah, I've seen many a bunch try that.
Never once have they succeeded.

If I remain idle, though... nothing
will change. 

I haven't done a thing... not since...
that day...

Perish the thought. I will go to them...


Edith

*yawn* Are we there yet?

Silence, sellsword! You will only talk
when you are being addressed to!

(Sheesh... you imperial lauts outta be
more respectful towards your associates...)

(It's not like we're protecting your
sorry asses out here, or anything...)

(Come to think of it, this whole job has
felt super weird... what do they need to 
be guarded from?)

(...This stinks. Something about these
guys is seriously bad news.)

(I need to get out of here. I bet they
wouldn't notice if one of their mercs
went missing in the heat of battle...)

(Pfft, loyalty. I was paid up-front!
I can quit whenever I want to!)

GeraldRecruitment

I am Gerald, armor of the arcane!
Take this aid I bring to you!

Whoa! What the hell are you thinking,
sneaking up on us like that?
You coulda blown our cover!

Do you not understand? I am here to
pledge myself to your cause!

Yeah, yeah, I heard that much...
Ah, excuse my temper there. I'm just
a little on edge, that's all.

Thing is... I'm not sure I trust you.

I do not expect you to.
My actions on the battlefield shall
speak to my purity of heart.

Is that so? I think we have a deal,
then.

If you can hold your own out there,
we'll accept you as a permanent
member of Storm Cabal.

I have yearned to fight for a cause ever
since Silesse first fell to Grannvale.
I shall not fail you... er...

The name's Neill.
Show me what you can do, Gerald!

EdithRecruitment

*thud*

Waaaaah! A bandit! I'll tear you apart
with my wind magic!

Who you callin' a bandit?

Why, you of course, you bandit!
No one that big would be carryin'
around an axe if they weren't a bandit!

That's a grave insult to every
lumberjack in Jugdral.

Hmm, that was definitely too quick of a 
comeback for a bandit...

That's because I'm not a bandit!
I fight for Storm Cabal! We're a vigilantee
group dedicated to-

Pssh... a vigilantee group? Puh-leez! What
kind of corny charity are you running here?

A damn good one, that's what. Wait...
aren't you supposed to be with the empire?

Oh, those droners? I've washed my hands of them.
I figure I'll use this money to buy some food,
maybe crash at someone's place in Silesse.

How about you team up with us instead? We're
about to go in 'n fight them imperial scum
ourselves.

I don't see harm in getting a little bit of
payback... hehe...

I don't feel fit to have it.
this... was meant for a fighter.


BATTLE QUOTES

Ack, an ambush!
Protect the cargo! They mustn't
see what's inside-!

Hrgh... I'm...
not cut out... for t-this...

I have buckled under the weight of shame.
Letting me live only prolongs my suffering...

This is the sort I'm supposed to fight off?
Tch, go figure...

Wow... what a lame way to die...

I'll just be on my merry way, then.
Cheers!

ENDING

Excellent work, team! We took a colossal
risk, but it seems to have paid off.

Let's get the cargo somewhere safe. 
We don't want to attract any more attention
than we already have.

Ma... Pa...

There are children here?! What are they 
doing in a cage? 

...

Barra? Your face... this must be something
grim, isn't it?

It's just as I suspected... They're trying
to conduct child hunts in Silesse.

Child hunts? They're hunting children?

It's the empire's most disgusting sin.

They adduct children barely old enough to
read, and indoctrinate them into a cult that
preaches hatred as one of its core tenets.

Your father and I visited Grannvale a few
years ago, and bore witness to the atrocity
of it all.

That was when you and father left me in 
charge to go find medicine for mother, right?

Indeed, it was...

You're very fortunate to have
grown up in a place spared 
from Loptyr's influence, Neill.

From the looks of it, though... we won't
be spared for much longer.

Is there nothing we can do about this?
I would hate to stand idle and allow
the empire to just consume Silesse...

If we were a fully-fledged army, maybe,
but as we are now, there's no chance.

You've seen it firsthand- we struggled
mightly just to take down an armed
transport.

At the very least, there's one good
thing that is within our power to 
accomplish-

Returning these children to their 
parents. 

We don't even know where they're from...
I suppose we could ask them?

Seadna, I don't know how to put this...
I'm not very good at consoling children.
Could you...?

I can certainly try.

*sniff* I jus' wanna go home...
Those scary people... they took us...

There, there... deep breaths...
You're safe, now...
I'm going to ask you a question now.

Mhm...

Can you tell us where you live?

A town... called Skanor.
We were playin' out in the forest...

Then, a bunch of armored men found us.
We were kidnapped. 

We cried for days, but no one came...
*sniff*

Don't worry... we'll get you home.
Safe... and sound... 

T-thank you, lady! I uh-pree...
uh-pree-sh... appreciate it!

Well, I think we know where we're
headed now.

Otto, how much food is there in the
cargo?

By my estimate, enough provisions to
last us for several weeks.

Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

Alright, everyone! We march towards
Skanor, starting tomorrow!

CHAPTER 3

MAP

Our intrepid heroes are just a stone's
throw away from Skanor.

They've set up camp in an 
abandoned town, 

With plans to resume travel in the
morning.

Unfortunately for Neill and his 
friends,

There would be no respite from
those who wished them harm...

OPENING 

If Edith recruited and alive

Look's like the sun has set.
This is when the nastier sort of
thugs begin to stir.
You're on guard duty for the next hour. 
We sleep in shifts, got it?

You can count on me!
(I had half a mind to just ditch these guys... but they don't seem so bad? It's weird. Either way... gotta stay on
the lookout for bad-) 
(guys...)
Keep your distance, mauraders!
You dwell on the ground of the famed mage, Edith Othello!
One wrong step, and you're out!
Ksshhaaahh...
Eek!
You fool, this is my territory...
The only way out of this place is to be cut to ribbons...

Augh! Your breath smells like horse shit!

You've failed your duty, and your friends... However, I have decided to give you a new purpose-
You shall be the bait which draws the rest into my clutches.

Hey-! Let go of me-! 

Shush. You've got your whole life ahead of you. What little of it there's left, that is...

Facthna... you disarmed her, right?
...

Ha! You're a capital S sucker! I can deliver you all to tartarus, even from the confines of this room!

Cripes! Change of plans, everyone! Shoot arrows at the wench until she stops moving!

You never learn, do ya? Here it comes!

What's that racket?
Edith?
...

Neill, get up! 
We've been discovered by bandits!

Bandits, again?
Its been one of those days...

Not really in the best shape to
fight, but I know, life or death 
'n all that.

Grab your weapons, everyone!
Edith can't hold them off forever!

[]If edith dead or unrecruited[]

I'm turning in for the night. 
You coming to bed, Barra?

I'm afraid not.
Even in a deserted fortress, someone 
has to keep a lookout for trouble.

I getcha... 
I really appreciate what you do
for us, Barra.

Just... don't burn yourself out.

I'm working well within my limits, Neill.

Are you sure about that?

Ever since father died, You've been
working yourself ragged!

You buy the food, you recruit the 
new blood, you draw the maps and 
draft all of our plans.

I'm supposed to be the leader, yet 
you're the one doing all of the 
heavy lifting.

What am I... but a burden to be
accounted for?

The worst thing about you, Neill...
Its that you always sell yourself short.

Your support is what keeps me going,
no matter how exhausted I get.

Someday...
Things in Silesse will get better.

Everyone'll have a roof over their head,
and we can finally clean the Empire 
off of our plate.

That may be a long way's off...
but with our teamwork, I know it'll happen.

I have a lot of things to think about...

Save it for tomorrow. Try to catch as
much shut eye as you can.

As much as I can...
You got it...

...
I know you're behind me.

Hark! You're keener than the last
bunch of fools I cut up...

We're just camping here for the night.
If you touch any of my friends, I'll
cave your head in. 

Feisty... I like that...

Stepping on my turf, though...
I take that a bit more personally.

If you wanna live through tonight,
You'll have to kill me first...

If that's what it takes, so be it.

Neill!

Huh? Barra... who are these...

Murderers. 
Get everyone you can, we're
going to be fighting till daybreak.
On the double!

Yes, sir!

So this is our prey...
Most interesting...
Meet me inside... 
If you long enough to see it...
Ksshhaaahh...

Seadna/Edith

empirestikesback

I assume you're aware of our plans, 
Agnes?

...Why them?

We cannot leave these rebels alive...
The knowledge they possess is far too
valuable.

It risks jeopardizing our entire operation.

Heh. It appears they are already occupied.
Your orders are to sneak past all the
commotion and slaughter them.
For your part in this cover up,
lord Durchval shall reward you handsomely.

Do you understand?

I have no further questions.

Do not disappoint us...

agnesandneill1

Who goes there?!

The one who shall take your head.

An assassin, huh?
No doubt you're on the empire's payroll!
If you want your precious goods back,
you'll have to go through me first!

(scripted battle where they miss each other)

Huhhh... I would've been a goner...
You... you went easy on me...
Why...?

Something stayed my hand. 
You weren't ready to face me.
I wasn't ready to face you either...

We've met before... haven't we?
I... I know you-!

I'm sorry... 
We weren't supposed to see each 
other like this...

Wait!

BATTLE QUOTES

Come, face your death!

OOOOUUUUURAAAAAAGGGHHH!

M-My knives! 
They were all I had!
I... I hate you! 

I'll make it quick.
May Naga rest your soul...


ENDING

Edith! Thank the heavens,
you're alright!

Oh, it was no trouble. 
Bandits waste themselves harder
than I ever could.

I had my doubts about this cabal thing,
But you were all surprisingly fierce
out there. 

Before this ambush deal started, I was
actually considering leaving your 
goody two-shoes group.

Now that I've seen what you guys 
get up to...

I think I'll stick around.
Its the least I can do to repay you.

Wonderful. 
I wouldn't be too pressured to stay
if I were you, though.

We can barely scrape by long enough
to keep everyone fed.
Wages are paltry, assuming we even have
gold to distribute in the first place.

Wages, bah! Who needs those?
With friends like you around, we'll
be raking in the dough someday!

As of now, I'm making an investment
towards the future I want to see.
Here's a bag of gold.

Whoa... there's gotta be at least 4000 in here!
Is this your entire savings?

Pretty much. When I was high-tailing it
from those empire jerks, I made off with
a few extra coins.

Greed has always been one of my more
pervasive sins...

I... can't thank you enough, Edith.

\branch\
How could we fail to save her?


\branch\

Goodness... I'm exhausted...
Was Silesse's crime rate always this high? 
I can hardly keep my eyes open...

Neill... who's protecting the children?

Oh, gods! 
I completely forgot about them!
Hurry, Barra!

\branch\

...Phew. They're sound asleep.





CHAPTER 4

MAP

At long last, Storm Cabal has reached
its destination.
The children they harbored were 
reunited with their parents once more.
The joy Neill and his friends felt
for a job well done would not last.
The empire remained steadfast in
their manhunt for the cabal.
But why do they so ardently pursue
a group of ordinary mercenaries?
Yet again, their work proved more
laborious than initially thought...

OPENING

Greetings, travelers. 
You all look thoroughly exhausted.
Come, rest a spell.

Thanks, I'd appreciate that...
Are you the one in charge
of this village here?

You could say that...
Months ago, I was but a wandering
priestess, in service of helping
those who fortune had long forgot.
Many days spent aimlessly wandering 
have brought me here.
It was a grisly sight. 
Illness had taken this village by storm. 
With their leadership wiped out, 
the people of Skanor were scared,
and directionless.
I could not sit idle and watch these
pure and kind folk suffer.
I tended to their wounds, bartered
for medicine, and oversaw the
reconstruction of rundown houses.
Before I knew it, I had been put in
charge of everything.
I am every bit as grateful to them
as they are to me. 

Wow! You musta been like a one-man army!

Don't be daft!
That would discredit the efforts of
those who've supported me for so long!

...Oh, pardon me, young man, but 
what is your name?

Call me Neill!

Neill, I would like to introduce 
you to a friend of mine-
He isn't very talkative, so please
be patient with him.

I'm Waulter, a local woodcutter.
I thought Ilsa here could use a hand,
so I did a few lifting jobs here 
and there... that's all.
Just wanted to do my part...
I'll tell ya, if it weren't for her, 
we'd all be lying under a pile of snow.

I think we've been well addressed...
Neill, what I would like to hear 
about is how you and your scrappy
friends saved this town's children.

/branch\

I can tell you how that happened.
We hijacked an imperial supply,
and found more than we bargained for.
The empire has been abducting children
for some kind of religious sacrifice.
It's too repulsive for words...

I'm speechless...
May the gods bless thee for your 
acts of kindness.
This town would have no future if
its youth were fed to Loptous.

The part that hurts me the most is
knowing the empire likely has way
more kids captured somewhere.
They're bleeding us dry, and once
we run out of means to fight back,
they'll come in 'n conquer us!
How can we ever hope to stop them?!

You need to take quick and effective
action to have any hope of haulting
further reinforcements.
The best able-bodied soldiers in
Silesse are currently positioned
with Princess Fee in Tofa.
If you can bring this news to her,
you might be able to mobilize a force 
strong enough to oppose Grannvale.

First of all- how would we even
reach Tofa? It's so far north!
The mountain range is utterly 
inhospitable! 
There's no way we can travel
through it and reach Tofa in time.
Secondly, you expect the royalty
to listen to some mercenaries out
in the boonies like us?
I'd almost sooner fight the empire
head on than try that!

...

Seadna, please... 
Try not to get too frustrated...
She's only trying to help...

I... you're right, Neill.

Take solace in what good we've made.
That's what Barra would say.
I think it applies here.

Let's just try to relax...
We'll think of something, I'm
sure of it.

Lady Ilsa!　An imperial battalion
has been sighted on the
outskirts of town!

(Oh, gods... could we not have
a little more time to spare?)

Have everyone escorted through
the north exit of town.

Waulter and I will hold them
off for as long as it takes
everyone to escape.

Now, hurry!

Wait! You can't possibly fend
them all off by yourselves!

You and Neill have a future
together. 
I will stay behind to protect
that future even it costs me
my life.

Let us lend a hand!
Any chance to lay into the 
empire is a great one!

I agree with the lass. 
You might be ready to sacrifice
yourself at the drop of a hat,
but I'm not.
I've got things left to do.
Let Neill and his friends
take arms.

I-I'll allow it...

Allow what?!
You ain't the boss of us!

...

Let's get started, shall we?

/branch\

We just sorta... happened upon them.
Most people guard their food and
money pretty securely, but if the 
empire is doing this with kids...
Something beyond vile is afoot.

I want to fight back. 
I can feel it in my bones...
The empire must be stopped!
...But how?

A group as small as yours doesn't
have the numbers to battle the
empire on any front.
You would have to designate
yourself an army, or join a 
larger one.
I say we take this to the highest
authority we can find- 
Princess Fee herself.
She's currently positioned in Tofa
with a regiment of the most skilled
soldiers in the country.
If you can bring this news to her,
you might be able to mobilize a force 
strong enough to oppose Grannvale.

That's a nice thought... but do
you really think that's possible?
At best, I'd be a courier, delivering 
urgent news to her majesty...
Which she will promptly ignore.
She wouldn't listen to me, even if
I made it over the gates.
I'm certainly not talented enough
to lead a full-scale army or wage
a war or something of that sort.
Maybe my father could've, but not me.

You have more potential than 
you could ever imagine.
Even if it feels hopeless... 
it won't hurt you to try.

That's easy for you to say.
You're not the one who has
to hike through a mountain
range to get there.

I wouldn't be opposed to 
travelling with you...

...

Waulter! 

Our worst fears have come
to pass. The empire is on
our doorstep.

...There's no time to waste.
Neill... are you and your
men in any condition to fight?

We will feel no relief until
the enemy's ranks are routed.
You have our support.

Battle stations, everyone!
Protect the civilians!

Seadna...
I must carry on...
That's what you would 
tell me to do...
Right? Right!?
...

When I was out in thick of it...
You were there.
An armored giant, setting men
ablaze with an ornate red sword...

BOSS QUOTES

I'm told you lot are due
for an execution...
Line up!

Hnnnghh... 
You're only d-delaying...
the inevitable...

I don't suppose you have
room for another hostage,
do you?

CIVILIAN ESCAPE QUOTES

CIVILIANS ESCAPE
Everyone's out!
Make a break for the exit!

FAILURE (civvy dies)
H-how could I...
They're... I couldn't...
I'm worthless...

FAILURE (Ilsa dies)
...Ilsa? Ilsa? ILSA?!

ENDING

neill
We're free...
Looks like the empire has 
lost our scent. 

barra
Don't let your guard down
just yet. We still need to
do a head count.

...Looks like everyone's
accounted for.

Neill, I want you
to grab extra blankets
for the families.

I have a feeling they'll
be travelling with us
for a while.

neill
Gotcha...

ilsa
Oh, brave warriors...
The humble folk of Skanor
and I owe their lives to you.


seadna
You have to wonder though...
why's the empire comin'
at us with full force?

At first, I thought it was
to recapture the kids...

otto
I believe I have found
a rationale to their 
motives.

seadna
Otto! 

otto
Further analysis of the
cargo has revealed items
previously undocumented.

Among these items were staves,
black-colored tomes, 
and most notably, a map.

The map points to an area in
the Tofa mountain range.

It's likely the supply we
raided was heading there.

neill
That's where they indoctrinate
kids into their cult, I'll bet.

Now, how do we get through the mountains?

ilsa
There is a fort north of here with a tunnel beneath it.
However... it is in the position of a very unscrupulous man.

Barra 
and that would be...?

ilsa
His name is Sionnach. He claims to be from the
Zaxonian royal family, and is trying to garner
favor from the monarchy.

Presumably in a bid to be recognized as a
legitimate heir to the throne. 
Though well mannered, Sionnach can be... talkative.

Convince him to let us through, and we'll be
able to reach Tofa in a handful of weeks.

neill
Wow, that's... really convienient.
I almost thought we would have to 
go around the mountain... that'd take us a year or more.

CHAPTER 7

BATTLE QUOTES
Why must you misunderstand us?
Do you yearn for death?

DEATH QUOTES
We are all equal... in the eyes of Loptous...

RELEASE QUOTES
You want to know more about... her?
I don't have all of the details...
She was found on the doorstep of one
of our cathedrals, barely alive.
A bishop took pity on the girl,
raising her as his own.
Bishop Maxima, I believe it was.
Master Durchval ordered her to
leave for Silesse while he lay
bedridden.
Her resentment towards the archbishop 
is palpable. You may be able to reason
with her.
...May I be released now?

DURCHVAL 2
They've raided our complex?!

I-I'm afraid so, sir.
Our efforts to route them
by bribing the local scum
bear no fruit.

And what of the fugitive 
retrieval squad? Or the 
mercenaries we hired?

Not a single one has reported
back, sir. The rebels and our
stolen goods remain at large...

That map they were carrying led
them right to us! 

...They had a map? 

You're all unfathomably stupid!
I want everyone responsible for 
this string of failures flayed!

Who, may I ask, was responsible
for managing this string of 
failures?

A-Archbishop Manfroy!
Your emminence, I...
I am at fault here. 
You've given me a task that
another of my rank could
handle without incident.
I owe my continued existence
to you, your bountiful mercy-

Silence! 
You will confront the army of
Silesse in person.
